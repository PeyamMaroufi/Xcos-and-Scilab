# Lead Lag Compensation in Scilab & Xcos

This is an example in implementing a lead lag compensation for a simple system. In this we will be using Xcos in Scilab. Xcos is a great alternative to Simulink in Matlab. It actually , for this porpuse does the same thing as Simulink. In the Start file you can see my comments and a litle theory before running the example.

Control theory is fun but it is not everything. As an engineer you will be using hardware as well hence it is very important for you to get to know control devices as well.
